## Data

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data) and contains historical sales data across various stores, including features that influence sales performance.

## Features

- **Sales:** Daily turnover for each store (target variable).
- **Customers:** Number of customers visiting the store daily.
- **Open:** Indicator for whether the store was open (0 = closed, 1 = open).
- **StateHoliday:** Type of state holiday affecting store operations.
- **SchoolHoliday:** Indicator for school holiday impacts.
- **StoreType:** Differentiates between four types of store models.
- **Assortment:** Level of product assortment available.
- **CompetitionDistance:** Distance to the nearest competitor store.
- **Promotions:** Information on promotional activities impacting sales.
